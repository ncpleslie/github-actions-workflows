# This is a full example using the sample client GitHub Actions.
# This action is to be triggered manually and would deploy a frontend and JavaScript/TypeScript API to Azure Static Web Apps.
# This will require an active Azure Static Web App environment and a secret added to your repo called "AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_DEV"
# containing the relevant Static Web App Token.

# Note: The frontend directory does not contain the "is-in-pr.yml" workflow. This can be located in the "other" directory.
# Note: The frontend directory does not contain the "javascript-build-api.yml" workflow. This can be located in the "backend/javascript" directory.
